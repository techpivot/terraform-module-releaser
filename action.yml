inputs:
  major-keywords:
    description: Keywords in commit messages that indicate a major release.
    required: true
    default: major change,breaking change
  minor-keywords:
    description: Keywords in commit messages that indicate a minor release.
    required: true
    default: feat,feature
  patch-keywords:
    description: >
      Keywords in commit messages that indicate a patch release. By default, everything will be a patch
      release if major or minor keywords are not found.
    required: true
    default: fix,chore,docs
  default-first-tag:
    description: Specifies the default tag version. (Should be in format v#.#.#)
    required: true
    default: v1.0.0
  terraform-docs-version:
    description: >
      Specifies the terraform-docs version used to generate documentation for the wiki.

      See: https://github.com/terraform-docs/terraform-docs/releases
    required: true
    default: v0.20.0
  delete-legacy-tags:
    description: >
      Specifies a boolean that determines whether tags from Terraform modules that have been deleted
      should be automatically removed. By default this is true as the purpose of the repository is to keep
      releases/tags clean. When removing a module, this will ensure the tags/releases are automatically
      cleaned.
    required: true
    default: "true"
  disable-wiki:
    description: >
      Whether to disable wiki generation for Terraform modules.
      By default, this is set to false. Set to true to prevent wiki documentation from being generated.
    required: true
    default: "false"
  wiki-sidebar-changelog-max:
    description: >
      An integer that specifies how many changelog entries are displayed in the sidebar per module.
      Adjust this value to control the visibility of changelog entries in the module sidebar.
    required: true
    default: "5"
  disable-branding:
    description: >
      Flag to control whether the small branding link should be disabled or not in the
      pull request (PR) comments. When branding is enabled, a link to the action's
      repository is added at the bottom of comments. Setting this flag to "true"
      will remove that link. Useful for cleaner PR comments in enterprise environments
      or where third-party branding is undesirable.
    required: true
    default: "false"
  module-path-ignore:
    description: >
      A comma-separated list of module paths to completely ignore during processing. Paths matching these patterns will
      not be considered for versioning, releases, or documentation generation. These patterns follow glob syntax and are 
      relative to the repository root. Use this to exclude example modules, test modules, or other paths that should not 
      be treated as releasable modules.

      This is a top-level filter: if a module matches any of these patterns, it is completely excluded from all release, versioning, and documentation logic. No releases will ever happen for a module that matches this filter.

      The minimatch syntax is used for pattern matching. Patterns are relative to the workspace directory (no leading
      slash).

      NOTE: To match both a directory and its contents, use separate patterns (e.g., "dir,dir/**").
    required: false
    default: ""
  module-change-exclude-patterns:
    description: >
      A comma-separated list of file patterns to exclude from triggering version changes in Terraform modules.
      These patterns follow glob syntax and are relative to each Terraform module directory, not the repository root.
      Files matching these patterns will be tracked in the module but changes to them won't trigger a new version.
      Uses matchBase: true for pattern matching, so patterns like "*.md" will match files in any subdirectory.

      This option allows you to release a module but control which files inside a matched Terraform module should not force a bump of the module version. For example, you may want to exclude documentation or test files from triggering a release, but still include them in the module asset bundle.

      WARNING: Avoid excluding '*.tf' files, as they are essential for module functionality and versioning.
    required: true
    default: ".gitignore,*.md,*.tftest.hcl,tests/**"
  module-asset-exclude-patterns:
    description: >
      A comma-separated list of file patterns to exclude when bundling a Terraform module for release assets.
      These patterns follow glob syntax and are relative to each Terraform module directory, not the repository root.
      Files matching these patterns will be excluded from the bundled release archives. Uses matchBase: true for 
      pattern matching, similar to module-change-exclude-patterns.

      These patterns only affect what's included in release assets and do not impact versioning decisions.
    required: true
    default: ".gitignore,*.md,*.tftest.hcl,tests/**"
  use-ssh-source-format:
    description: >
      If enabled, all links to source code in generated Wiki documentation will use SSH format instead of HTTPS format.
    required: true
    default: "false"
  github_token:
    description: >
      Required for retrieving pull request metadata, tags, releases, updating PR comments, wiki, and creating 
      tags/releases. Automatically injected for convenience; no need to provide a custom token unless you have 
      specific requirements.
    required: true
    default: ${{ github.token }}
